# SmartScan Wireframe (SNHU Project)
This project is a wireframe prototype for a healthy food scanning app.

## Overview
The app allows users to scan food barcodes and receive a color-coded health rating:
- ðŸŸ¥ Red = Unhealthy
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = Neutral
- ðŸŸ© Green = Healthy  

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment was to apply **user-centered design principles** by:
- Understanding user needs through personas and interviews
- Creating simple, intuitive wireframes
- Planning out navigation and user flow before coding
