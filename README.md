# SmartScan Wireframe (SNHU Project)
This project is a wireframe prototype for a healthy food scanning app, created as part of my coursework in **CS 319 â€“ Mobile App Design**.  

## Overview
The app allows users to scan food barcodes and receive a color-coded health rating:
- ðŸŸ¥ Red = Unhealthy
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = Neutral
- ðŸŸ© Green = Healthy  

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment was to apply **user-centered design principles** by:
- Understanding user needs through personas and interviews
- Creating simple, intuitive wireframes
- Planning out navigation and user flow before coding  

## Contents
- `/wireframes` â†’ exported PNG/PDF of wireframes  
- `/docs` â†’ project write-up and analysis  

## Skills Demonstrated
- UX/UI Design Principles  
- Wireframing & Prototyping (Lucidchart, Figma, or Balsamiq)  
- User-centered design process
